# ASCII-Art-Generator
In this project I have written a python script which converts a given image into one made out of ASCII characters. I have also written scripts for pencil sketch ASCII image generation and command line ASCII video generation

I had installed OpenCV and Pillow library which enable us to seamlessly work with images on python.

You can create ASCII image of any jpg,png,jp2,webp file by easily storing it in the "Input" folder directory and editing the path of the file in line 31 of "ASCII_Coloured.py" file or "Pencil_Sketch.py" (if you want the pencil sketch).

You can run the command line video by storing the video file in Input folder and editing the path in line 25 of "ASCII_Vid.py" file, and the corresponding command line video would be generated. It is preffered to have a video with white background for the command line video generator for a more clear output.

The project help me learn more about OpenCV and Pillow library while also strengthening my Python on knowledge. It also increased my confidence as a programmer and most importantly it improved my patience for I spent hours debugging the code to fine minute silly mistakes.

I watched the ACM workshop videos on ASCII Art Generator. Apart from the I intensively used GeekForGeeks platform for to learn about the different library functions of Pillow and OpenCV. I also watch a few Youtube tutorials to better understand the concept behind pencil sketching of the image.
